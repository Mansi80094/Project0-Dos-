DoS_SQL
*Project Overview*

This project is designed to simulate a comprehensive system for detecting, monitoring, and responding to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The system is built using MySQL databases to log real-time data on network traffic, system resources, attack incidents, and threat intelligence. The goal is to provide a centralized platform for monitoring DoS activity, generating alerts, and responding to incidents effectively.

1. Attack_Detection
   
Description: Stores information about detected attacks and their sources.

Tables:

attacks: Logs detected attacks (type, date, source IP).

attack_types: Defines various DoS attack categories.

sources: Logs attacker IPs and geographical origins.

detection_rules: Stores detection rules for DoS attacks.

alerts: Tracks alerts generated for detected attacks.

2. Network_Traffic
   
Description: Logs and monitors network traffic to identify DoS attack patterns.

Tables:

traffic: Records traffic data between IP addresses.

protocols: Stores network protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.).

ip_addresses: Logs source and destination IPs.

network_devices: Details devices connected to the network.

traffic_stats: Tracks traffic volume over time.

3. System_Resources
   
Description: Monitors system resources under heavy traffic from DoS attacks.

Tables:

resource_usage: Logs CPU, memory, and disk usage.

resources: Provides descriptions of the system's resources.

system_stats: Records system load and uptime statistics.

process_list: Logs processes running on the system.

user_sessions: Tracks user login sessions.

4. Incident_Response
   
Description: Handles response actions to DoS incidents and logs them for analysis.

Tables:

incidents: Records incidents related to DoS attacks.

incident_types: Defines types of security incidents.

response_plans: Stores predefined response plans for incidents.

response_teams: Logs response team details.

incident_reports: Logs post-incident reports and analysis.


5. Security_Information
   
Description: Tracks vulnerabilities, patches, and threat intelligence data.

Tables:

vulnerabilities: Logs system vulnerabilities and severity.

patches: Records information about system patches.

security_advisories: Stores security advisories from vendors.

threat_intelligence: Tracks known threats and their severity.

security_incidents: Logs related security incident details.


*Project Features*

1. Real-time Attack Detection: Using MySQL tables to store real-time data on traffic and resource usage, the system can detect abnormal patterns associated with DoS attacks.

2. Alerts and Notifications: Alerts are generated when a potential attack is detected based on predefined rules in the detection_rules table.

3. Incident Response: The system includes response plans and teams, stored in the Incident_Response database, to handle detected incidents promptly.

4. Threat Intelligence: Information on vulnerabilities and threat intelligence is logged for proactive security measures.


*Usage*

1. The system will monitor network traffic and system resource usage.

2. When abnormal traffic is detected (e.g., SYN flood), it will log the attack in the Attack_Detection database.

3. Administrators will receive alerts based on the severity of the attack.

4. The response team can access Incident_Response tables to coordinate a mitigation plan.


*Future Enhancements*

1. Integration with real-time Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

2. Automated incident reporting using machine learning for enhanced accuracy.

3. Support for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection.
